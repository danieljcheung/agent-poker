# Domain Options for Agent Poker

Researched 2026-02-04. Prices are approximate (Cloudflare Registrar = at-cost).

## Top Picks

| Domain | Est. Price/yr | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **agentpoker.gg** | ~$20 | 🏆 Best pick. ".gg" = gaming culture. Short, memorable, perfect fit. |
| **agentpoker.dev** | ~$12 | Clean, signals "for developers". Good for the SDK angle. |
| **aipoker.gg** | ~$20 | Even shorter. Broader — could expand beyond "agents" to general AI poker. |
| **agentpoker.io** | ~$35 | Classic tech domain. Bit overused/pricey. |
| **agentpoker.fun** | ~$2-5 | Cheapest option. Casual vibe, could work. |
| **agentpoker.co** | ~$25 | Clean but easy to confuse with .com. |

## Also Available (Niche)

| Domain | Est. Price/yr | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| agentarena.poker | ~$40-50 | ".poker" TLD exists! Cool but expensive + obscure. |
| pokeragent.dev | ~$12 | Reversed word order. Less natural. |
| pokerbots.dev | ~$12 | Decent but "bots" has negative connotation. |
| agentpoker.app | ~$15 | Fine but implies a mobile app. |
| aipokertable.com | ~$10 | Too long. |

Runner-up: **agentpoker.dev** if going for the developer-tool angle over the gaming angle.

Budget pick: **agentpoker.fun** at ~$2-5/yr to start, upgrade later.
